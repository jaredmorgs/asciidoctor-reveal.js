= Slide State

reveal.js supports a link:{url-revealjs-doc}#slide-states[data-state] tag that can be added on slides which gets rendered into `<section>` tags.
In AsciiDoc the `data-state` can be applied to a slide by adding a state attribute to a section like this:

[source, asciidoc]
----
[state=topic]
== Epic Topic
----

That state can be queried from JavaScript or used in CSS to apply further customization to your slide deck.
For example, by combining this feature with the xref:custom-styles.adoc#customcss[CSS override] one, you can alter fonts for specific pages with this CSS:

[source, css]
----
@import 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Baloo+Bhai';

section[data-state="topic"] h2 {
    font-family: 'Baloo Bhai', cursive;
    font-size: 4em;
}
----
