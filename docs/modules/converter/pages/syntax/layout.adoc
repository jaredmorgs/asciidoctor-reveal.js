= Layout

== Stretch class attribute

reveal.js supports a special class that will give all available screen space to an HTML element.
This class element is named `stretch`.

Sometimes it's desirable to have an element, like an image or video, stretch to consume as much space as possible within a given slide.

To add this class to an HTML element, you can assign a role to a block using the shorthand dot (`.`) syntax:

    [.stretch]

See link:{url-revealjs-doc}#stretching-elements[reveal.js documentation on stretching elements].

== Vertical slides

[source,asciidoc]
....
== Slide 6

Top slide

=== Slide 6.1

This is a vertical sub-slide
....

Slide 6 uses the vertical slide feature of `reveal.js`.
Slide 6.1 will be rendered vertically below Slide 6.
Here is link:{url-revealjs-doc}#markup[the relevant reveal.js documentation^] on that topic.

== Columns layout

Inspired by {url-bulma}[Bulma^], Asciidoctor reveal.js supports columns layout out-of-the-box:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[.columns]
== 2 columns

[.column]
--
* **Edgar Allen Poe**
* Sheri S. Tepper
* Bill Bryson
--

[.column]
--
Edgar Allan Poe (/poʊ/; born Edgar Poe; January 19, 1809 – October 7, 1849) was an American writer, editor, and literary critic.
--
....

If you do not specify a size, each column will have an equal width, no matter the number of columns.

[source,asciidoc]
....
[.columns]
== 3 columns

[.column]
* Java
* **Kotlin**

[.column]
* Node
* **Deno**

[.column]
* Ruby
* **Crystal**
....

If you want to change the size of a single column, you can use one of the following classes:

* `is-three-quarters`
* `is-two-thirds`
* `is-half`
* `is-one-third`
* `is-one-quarter`
* `is-full`

The other columns will fill up the remaining space automatically. +
You can use the following multiples of 20% as well:

* `is-four-fifths`
* `is-three-fifths`
* `is-two-fifths`
* `is-one-fifth`

[source,asciidoc]
....
[.columns]
== Columns with size

[.column.is-one-third]
--
* **Kotlin**
* Java
* Scala
--

[.column]
--

....

The vertical alignment of columns defaults to top aligned.
Content can be centered by adding the `is-vcentered` class to the slide.

[source,asciidoc]
....
[.columns.is-vcentered]
== Columns Vertically Centered

[.column]
--
* Few
* Bullets
* Here
--

[.column]
image::large-image.png[]
....

Text alignment of columns is also supported.
Text content on individual columns can be aligned with `has-text-left`, `has-text-right` and `has-text-justified` CSS classes.

[source,asciidoc]
....
[.columns]
== Column Text Alignment

[.column.has-text-left]
--
Something Short

Something So Long That We Need It Aligned

[.column.has-text-justified]
