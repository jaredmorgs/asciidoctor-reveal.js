= Videos

In addition to xref:syntax/background.adoc#background_videos[background videos], videos can be inserted directly into slides.
The syntax is the standard xref:asciidoc:macros:audio-and-video.adoc#video-macro-syntax[AsciiDoc video block macro] syntax.

By default videos are given as much space as possible.
To override that behavior use the `width` and `height` named attributes.
