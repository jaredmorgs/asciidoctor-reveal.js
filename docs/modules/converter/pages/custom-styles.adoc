[[customcss]]
== CSS Override

If you use the `:customcss:` document attribute, a CSS file of the name given in the attribute is added to the list of CSS resources loaded by the rendered HTML.
Doing so, you can then override specific elements of your theme per presentation.

For example, to do proper position-independent text placement of a title slide with a specific background you can use:

[source, css]
----
.reveal section.title h1 {
    margin-top: 2.3em;
}

.reveal section.title small {
    margin-top: 15.3em;
    font-weight: bold;
    color: white;
}
----

If the `:customcss:` attribute value is empty then `asciidoctor-revealjs.css` is the CSS resource that the presentation is linked to.
